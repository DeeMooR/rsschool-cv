## About myself
I am 17 years old and not so long ago I found my calling in programming) I watched a video on YouTube and gradually studied HTML, CSS, JavaScript   
I am also fond of assembling the Rubik's Cube for speed. At the age of 15, together with a friend, I organized official competitions in which 44 speedcubers took part. I love making videos. 2 years ago I took my first freelance order: travel video editing.
I also love taking photos and editing them.
